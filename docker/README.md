# üß∞ Homelab Services Overview

This page lists the core services running in my self-hosted homelab environment. Each service is containerized (via Docker) and serves a specific role, from identity management and monitoring to development and continuous integration.

## üìå Usage Tips

- Use **Authentik** to integrate SSO with apps like Portainer, Uptime Kuma, and Code-Server.
- Secure your external access using **Nginx Proxy Manager** with SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt.
- Keep everything up-to-date with **Watchtower**, but monitor for breaking changes in container images.
- Pair **Ntfy** with your scripts or services (like Jenkins or Uptime Kuma) to get real-time alerts.
